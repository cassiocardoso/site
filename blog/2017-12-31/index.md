It was good.

In the beginning of 2017 my wife and I were looking for a new apartment. Our last contract was set to expire in last July, but we were unhappy with the old apartment as it was very small and not cozy at all. We started to look for new apartments in January and after a couple weeks of search we found a gem: a nice apartment in the corner of our street and within our budget. Awesome. We moved in in the beginning of February and since that we had sunsets like this from our window:

## Work hard

The first half of the year was very good professionally. We got into the final parts of developing AMARO's new e-commerce platform and with that I was able to contribute with nice stuff while learning others. We did a post about this, here.

After launching it I felt like my time at AMARO was coming to an end, it was a nice journey but I needed a change. So in October I left AMARO to join QuintoAndar, a nice startup that is making rental easy and cool here in Brazil.

It was a scary move in the beginning, but I feel like it was the right call. I'm being able to work with a new group of very talented people, learning new stuff and developing a nice product.

## Coding (almost) everyday

During the year I tried to code as much as I could. Not only on the professional side, but I did some courses and developed some side projects. This is something I'll continue doing in the next year.

Right now I feel comfortable taking a React project and building upon it, so my focus next year will be more on back-end, developing APIs, continuous delivery and deployment as I see these stuff as things that I can improve a lot.

## Health

During the last months of 2016 I started my marathon towards a healthier diet, my plan is to lose some fat during the next 6–8 months then maintain a better diet during the week, to allow for some cheat meals in the weekends.

I'm not setting hard goals right now, I just want to get better everyday and improve my conditioning.

## Football

In December, we organised the first encounter with (almost) all players that participated in [Taubaté Big Donkeys](https://www.facebook.com/bigdonkeys/) history. This was a very cool moment where we could meet friends again, remember some stories and play some football.

I also got a special surprise gift, my old number (#82) was retired by the team. This is something I wasn't expecting, and it means a lot to me. It's the recognition of the work I put during my time there.

I enjoyed every moment I spent there. Days like this make us proud of what we were able to build. I’m not aiming a comeback, but we never know right?
