Between **[me]**, representing the **[company]** and you **[client]**.

## TL;DR

I will always do my best to fill your needs and exceed your expectations, but it is important that we have these things written down so we can know our agreements, responsibilities, deadlines and what to do in case something goes wrong. In this contract you will not find any complicated terms, huge paragraphs or dubious text. I don't have the intention of trickying you into signing something you will regret in the future. What I want is the best for both parts, now and in the future.

So, to summarize:

You **[client's name]**, located at **[client's address]** is hiring the company: **[company's name]**, represented by **[me]**, located at **[company's address]**, to **[develop an institutional website]**, for the total amount of **[$ XXXX,YY (X thousand *currency*)]**, as previously agreed in our conversations.

## What we have agreed

**You:** You have authority to sign this contract in your name and representing your company and/or organization. You will provide everything I need to complete the project, when and in the required formats. You will review the work, provide _feedback_ and approve the project following the schedule. The deadlines apply to both sides, so you will be also committed to the dates we set together. You also agree to follow the payment schedule that is specified at the end of this contract.

**I:** I have the experience and ability to do everything we have agreed, and everything will be done professionally and following our agreed schedule. We will meet to review each part of the project and will maintain the confidentiality about the project.

## What will be done

### Design

I will create a _design_ that is intuitive and easy to navigate for the users. The implementation will be responsive, which means it will adapt to the different screen resolutions. The _layout_ development will be made mainly using HTML and CSS, to speed up the process and for you to see how it will look in real devices once finished. Images can be used to demonstrate some elements like: color scheme, textures, typography, among others.

You will have several opportunities to reivew the work and provide _feedback_. All work will be available through a shared folder in an online service (Dropbox or Google Drive) so you can access them at any time. If at any point in the development, you are not happy with how the things are going, you can cancel the contract, paying only the installments referring up to that part of the development.

### Content (copyright)

The content of the website (copyright) will be provided by you. If you want, I can create this content but we will need to agree on a separate payment for this service.

### Images (drawings, photos, images)

You are responsible for providing images that I can use in the website. I will need them in the highest resolution possible (vector formats are preferred) and free of trademarks. You can opt to buy images in the internet and I can help you with that by providing a list of websites that have good image libraries.

### Testing in browsers

Testing the website in different browsers doesn't mean that it will look the same in each browser, in each different resolution and operating system. The goal is to guarantee that the brand style is recognized and the user has a good experience regarding the device they are using.

Browsers and operating systems covered in the tests are the following:

<!-- Browser testing table -->

    <tr>
      <td>Browsers \ Operating systems</td>

### Technical support

I will provide you with a few options that I think are the best options to host your website. In our contract, the price will include setting up the domain, and hosting for one year. If you want to manage this things on your own, no problem, we can deduct it from the price of my service, but I will charge to help if needed. The website will have a data analysis tool configured (Google Analytics).

As the domain and hosting must be renewed every year, this services will be included in the price for the first year only. Subsequent renewals will be charged separately as necessary.

#### SEO (Search Engine Optimisation)

I can not guarantee that your site will "_appear in the first position of Google_" as soon as I finish the development as there are a lot of factors in this equation. But I can guarantee that the website will be develop to facilitate the indexing by search engines (like Google, Bing, Yahoo, among others) and it will increase your chances of being well positioned.

### Changes and reviews

I know that fixed price contracts are usually not good for you, the client, because they can limit your creativity after the initial idea. I have no intention of limiting you, in fact, my goal is to do exactly what you want. But if we need to update some part of the website, I may have to update the deliery schedule and the price of the project. For this cases, just let me know as soon as you have an idea, and we can reach an agreement of how to proceed in the particular case.

### Legal terms

I can not guarantee that the work will be error-free, and therefore I can not be held liable by you or any third party for any damages, including profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you have advised me of they.

Finally, if any provision of this agreement is found to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

That is it.

## Copyrights

First, you warrant that any text, image, or any art you provide is of your own making, or of your partners, or that you are permitted to use them.

Then, when the last installment of the payment is deposited, the copyright will be put as follows:
