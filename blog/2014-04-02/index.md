**Date:** [signature date]

Between **[me]**, representing the **[company]** and you **[client]**.

## Summary

None of us will share any confidential information about the other, in any way, with anyone.

## What is a confidential information?

It's anything we write or talk to each other in a phone conversation, by mail, by email, and by any other method of communication including smoke signals and telepathy. This information can be related to the project, be about business or something technical like a password. Nothing is excluded. If we share this, it is covered.

We will keep the shared information confidential, and will not use it except for the reason it was shared. I will do everything possible to ensure that this information is kept confidential and kept in a safe place. That means keeping files, accessing the system online, and any user _login_ information in a way that does not fall into the wrong hands.

If we see that there is a small chance, however small, of the information being compromised, we agree to tell the other so we can take all security measures and protect ourselves. We also agree to help each other resolve any issues that may arise should confidential information be compromised.

When this agreement is reached, we will return any materials, physical or digital, and will delete any copies we may have. Do not forget to empty the trash afterwards.

## What can we say?

This agreement does not apply to any information that is already in the public domain or that may be in the future. Although I hope this never happens, the agreement does not cover the situation where the police pay me a visit, in which case I will be required by law to provide the information.

## How long is this agreement valid?

Unless we have agreed otherwise, using a separate agreement, for example, this agreement lasts 1 (one) year, from the date of the most recent subscription below.

When the agreement is terminated, we may come together to determine which terms of the agreement should remain confidential forever, this may include a password or information about a project or service.

## Where are the small letters?

Like a parking card, we can not simply transfer this contract to anyone else without permission. If, for any reason, part of this agreement becomes invalid, the other parties will continue to be valid.

Although the language is simple, the intent of the contract is serious, and this contract is a legal document, [under the jurisdiction ...]

## The dotted line

Signed by **[me]** in behalf of **[my company]**. And by **[you]** in behalf of **[your company]**.

Date: **[XX of XXX of 20XX]**

Everyone should sign up and keep a copy of this document.
