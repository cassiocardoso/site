There are several thousand extensions available for Google Chrome in its Web Store, from games to meditation
and a handful of other topics and, of course, we have options that will help a developer's life.
In this article I'll list the extensions I've been using recently and why I think they're worth.

I will come back to update this post every once in a while to make sure the list is always up-to-date.

## 1 Password X

My password manager of choice. it's paid but, I have been using the family plan for a while and think it's worth it.
There are other options (some free) that you could choose from, but I don't know how good they are.
Will keep using this one for the foreseeable future.

## Adblock Plus

Nobody wants to see a lot of ads on every page, right? So this one is pretty much self-explanatory.

## Awesome Screenshot

This enables to take screenshots from pages, parts of the page, and even full-page screenshots
(when the entire page doesn't fit in the screen viewport), you can also mark, comment and contribute
in the screenshots. To be honest, I haven't been using it a lot recently, but its always there,
specially for the full-page screenshot feature.

## Clear cache

Clear you cache. For good.

## Dataslayer

It's a debugger for GTM/GA where you can inspect what's being passed in the dataLayer,
you can see the events, the data, etc.

## EditThisCookie

Cookie editor.

## GitHub Issue Link Status

Add links to issues and pull requests in comments.
This is one of the extensions that keeps me thinking: "why this is not a standard GitHub feature?"

## Grammarly for Chrome

Being a non native english speaker, this is an absolute must-have in every device.

## JSONView

Prints JSON documents in a nice way, with collapsible panels and etc.

## Octotree

Adds a sidebar to GitHub that enables you to navigate through the code tree and easily
access a specific file inside some folder.

## Panda 5

This is my home screen. It's customizable, it's connected to a ton of news feed and serves as inspiration to check
some random Dribbble shots.

## React Developer Tools

Self explanatory.

## Redux Devtools

Self explanatory.

## Refined GitHub

A set of enhancements for GitHub, made by Sindre Sorhus.

## Tab Snooze

It's a kind of read-it-later list that you can add some pages. It has some nice option of when it should show you
the page (in a day, in a week, in a specific date, in a random date, etc).

## The Great Suspender

Puts a tab to sleep after some time. It helps improving the RAM consumption.
