    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>
      This is a collection of thoughts on how I behave as a manager and what I expect from you as an
      employee. This is a living document, which means that some opinions here may change over time.
      But if you see me behaving differently from what is described here, let me know asap.
    </p>
    <h2>
      What this is <strong>NOT</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is not a replacement for we getting to know each other during the daily routines and
      one-on-ones. Hopefully, this is a helpful resource in the beginning.
    </p>
    <h2>Communication</h2>
    <p>
      I&apos;m fairly open to talk about my hobbies, work, career, and personal matters. If you want
      to know something, ask me. I hope that over time we can build a trusting relationship where we
      can talk openly about all of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      I expect you to talk about your problems. If something happened let me know as soon as
      possible and we will find some time to talk about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If something urgent comes up, don&apos;t wait for the next one-on-one, write me on Slack and
      let&apos;s talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to keep my agenda public, you are encouraged to find a free slot and schedule a meeting
      there any time you need.
    </p>
    <p>
      I expect that you contribute with ideas, raise problems and propose solutions, and make that
      communication as effectively as possible.

    </p>
    <p>
      I respect the ability to respond immediately and the need to thoughtfully reflect and get back
      to me. I&apos;m the latter, so you can expect that from me.
    </p>
    <h2>The Actual work</h2>
    <p>Own your work. Ask questions, clarify, test, cover edge cases, deploy, monitor.</p>
    <p>
      Own the failures, treat them as learning opportunities. Be transparent, ask for help if you
      can&apos;t find the root cause. Share the learning. I&apos;ve got you back 100% of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Show Up. Don&apos;t be late to meetings. If you can&apos;t avoid it, let the others know asap.
    </p>
    <p>
      I expect you to become a better coder than I am (if you are not already), that means I will
      trust you to make the best decisions. I will, however, ask clarifying questions so I can fully
      understand it.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use me as a rubber duck at any time. In fact, I will be happy to hear your ideas and
      provide some context if you need.
    </p>
    <h2>Transparency</h2>
    <p>
      The company may ask me to hold information for some time before announcing. They can&apos;t
      ask me to lie to you. I would never agree to do that.
    </p>
    <p>
      I bias towards transparency and candor. If you want to know something, ask. I will try my best
      to always answer to any question. If I can&apos;t or don&apos;t know the answer, I&apos;ll do
      my best to figure it out and come back to you.
    </p>
    <h2>Feedback Loop</h2>
    <p>
      I&apos;ll always give you direct feedback as quickly as possible. Sometimes with action
      points, other times I&apos;ll let it to you to come up with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I expect you to do the same for me. I&apos;m here to help you, but I need to know where
      I&apos;m failing to improve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personal and organizational goals should be aligned and heading towards the same direction. If
      this is not happening, let me know and we&apos;ll figure it out.
    </p>
    <h2>Professional Development</h2>
    <p>
      Own your career path. I&apos;m here to help, guide and provide opportunities for you to
      achieve what you want.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are unsure about what to do, give each option a try. This is the best way to know how
      it would play out. I expect you to redefine your goals from time to time and to communicate
      those with me so we can align our plans and look for new opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keep pushing yourself. Be eager to learn, ask for opportunities. Continue to develop your
      skills.
    </p>
    <h2>One on ones</h2>
    <p>
      These meetings are for <strong>us</strong> (but mostly, for you). I expect you to bring
      what&apos;s on your mind, successes, concerns, and above all, how I can help you.
    </p>
    <p>
      It shouldn&apos;t be focused on project updates, this can be done at different times. We can
      discuss tech stuff but we should focus on what you need to do to overcome the roadblocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&apos;ll keep track of our meetings and I expect you to drive the direction of the meetings.
      If you don&apos;t have any topics, I&apos;ll always have a few questions to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
      The focus is to build a relationship. I&apos;m here to support you and your growth. Your part
      is letting me know how.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Urgent matters shouldn&apos;t wait for a one-on-one. Slack or call me and we&apos;ll talk
        asap.
